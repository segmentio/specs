# Specs

Specs is a high level dashboard for viewing your [ECS][ecs] clusters. For a more complete description, [see the blog post][blog].

Specs can quickly show you:

  - the services a given cluster is running
  - the desired count of a given service
  - the tagged docker image running
  - the most recent events of a service

We built Specs to work around the sluggishness of the internal AWS dashboard. It allows for quick searching, and doesn't require paging through results. And if you run it internally, your teammates won't need any separate IAM users or permissions.

## Docker

It's easiest to run Specs with docker. Assuming you have your AWS credentials exported, simply run the container like this:

    $ docker run \
      -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" \
      -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" \
      -e "AWS_REGION=$AWS_REGION" \
      -e "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" \
      -p 3000:3000 \
      $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/specs

## IAM Permissions

In order to run Specs, you'll need to create an IAM user or role with the following permissions:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Action": [
            "ecs:Describe*",
            "ecs:DiscoverPollEndpoint",
            "ecs:List*",
            "ecs:Poll"
          ],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }

Then you should be off to the races.

## Development

To develop, you'll first need to install [node][node]. Then, you can run the server and client builders, both of which will watch for changes and hot-reload.

Run the server and client (with has your AWS credentials exported) with the following:

    $ npm run dev

If you encouter this error: `ConfigError: Missing region in config` you will need to provide a default config environment or set the AWS_REGION environment variable like the following:

    $ AWS_REGION=us-east-1 npm run dev
